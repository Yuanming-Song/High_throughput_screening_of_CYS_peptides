Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  1.00000e+00
   Number of steps    =        15000

Energy minimization has stopped, but the forces have not converged to the
requested precision Fmax < 1 (which may not be possible for your system). It
stopped because the algorithm tried to make a new step whose size was too
small, or there was no change in the energy since last step. Either way, we
regard the minimization as converged to within the available machine
precision, given your starting configuration and EM parameters.

Double precision normally gives you higher accuracy, but this is often not
needed for preparing to run molecular dynamics.

Steepest Descents converged to machine precision in 9287 steps,
but did not reach the requested Fmax < 1.
