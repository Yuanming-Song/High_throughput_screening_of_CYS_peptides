NOTE 1 [file C_A_A_SIRAH.top, line 180]:
  The bond in molecule-type Protein_chain_A between atoms 1 GN and 2 GC has
  an estimated oscillational period of 1.5e-01 ps, which is less than 10
  times the time step of 2.0e-02 ps.
  Maybe you forgot to change the constraints mdp option.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein is 8999.64
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group SIRAH-Solvent is 66729.36

NOTE 2 [file /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/ML-MD-Peptide/SIRAH/mdp_files/eq2_CGPROT.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
