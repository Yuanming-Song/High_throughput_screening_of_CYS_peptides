Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 8x8x8 boxes
Solvent box contains 31488 atoms in 7872 residues
Removed 4936 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 4220 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    WT4 (   4 atoms):  5583 residues
Generated solvent containing 22332 atoms in 5583 residues
Writing generated configuration to A_C_G_CG_solvated.gro

Output configuration contains 25632 atoms in 6483 residues
Volume                 :        2197 (nm^3)
Density                :     3132.45 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   5583   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up A_C_G_SIRAH.top to ./#A_C_G_SIRAH.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "We had the quaint notion at the time that software should be completely, absolutely free of bugs. Unfortunately it's a notion that never really quite caught on." (Mary Allen Wilkes)

Adding line for 5583 solvent molecules with resname (WT4) to topology file (A_C_G_SIRAH.top)
