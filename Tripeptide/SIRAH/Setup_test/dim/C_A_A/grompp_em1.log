Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 77505.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 1 [file /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/ML-MD-Peptide/SIRAH/mdp_files/em1_CGPROT.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.

GROMACS reminds you: "I wanted to have a real language where programmers could write real programs, and see whether they would find the idea of data abstraction at all useful." (Barbara Liskov)
