Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 4x4x4 boxes
Solvent box contains 20818 atoms in 20818 residues
Removed 3356 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 1798 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration

      W (   1 atoms): 15664 residues
Generated solvent containing 15664 atoms in 15664 residues
Writing generated configuration to P_P_C_CG_solvated.gro

Output configuration contains 17464 atoms in 16564 residues
Volume                 :        2197 (nm^3)

Number of solvent molecules:  15664   


GROMACS reminds you: "Even the *healthy* people move in clouds of cigarette smoke, women straining polyester, men in raggedly cutoffs slathering mayonnaise on foot-long hot dogs. It's as if the hotel were hosting a conference on adult onset diabetes" (Jess Walter)
