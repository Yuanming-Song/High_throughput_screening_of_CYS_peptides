NOTE 1 [file C_H_H_SIRAH.top, line 292]:
  You are combining position restraints with Parrinello-Rahman pressure
  coupling, which can lead to instabilities. If you really want to combine
  position restraints with pressure coupling, we suggest to use C-rescale
  pressure coupling instead.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein is 14399.43
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group SIRAH-Solvent is 61293.57

NOTE 2 [file /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/ML-MD-Peptide/SIRAH/mdp_files/NPT_solvent_CGPROT.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
