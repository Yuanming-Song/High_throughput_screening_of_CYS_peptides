WARNING 1 [file /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/FFssFF/CG_single/ubiquitin/martini//equilibration.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution, and should not be used for new production simulations (in
  our opinion). We would recommend the V-rescale thermostat.


WARNING 2 [file /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/FFssFF/CG_single/ubiquitin/martini//equilibration.mdp]:
  The Berendsen barostat does not generate any strictly correct ensemble,
  and should not be used for new production simulations (in our opinion).
  For isotropic scaling we would recommend the C-rescale barostat that also
  ensures fast relaxation without oscillations, and for anisotropic scaling
  you likely want to use the Parrinello-Rahman barostat.

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.292 nm, buffer size 0.192 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.208 nm, buffer size 0.108 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

This run will generate roughly 2 Mb of data
