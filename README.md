Di-, Tri-, and Tetrapeptide dir contains scripts to setup and slurm job submission files for CGMD simulations of all single cystine containing sequences of both monomer and disulfide linked dimer simulations.

Csizedist is cluster size distribution data, in each rda file, first column is clustersize, other columns are density, column name indicates peptide sequence

Edgelist is for edgelist of each peptide

gyrt is gyration tensor for analyzing the shape of the aggregates

AP analysis is for aggregation propensity score calculation
