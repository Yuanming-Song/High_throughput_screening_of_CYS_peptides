Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 8x8x8 boxes
Solvent box contains 31488 atoms in 7872 residues
Removed 4936 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 4332 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    WT4 (   4 atoms):  5555 residues
Generated solvent containing 22220 atoms in 5555 residues
Writing generated configuration to C_A_A_CG_solvated.gro

Output configuration contains 25520 atoms in 6455 residues

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up C_A_A_SIRAH.top to ./#C_A_A_SIRAH.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "We all understand the twinge of discomfort at the thought that we share a common ancestor with the apes. No one can embarrass you like a relative." (Neal DeGrasse Tyson)
