Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 79017.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 1 [file /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/ML-MD-Peptide/SIRAH/mdp_files/em1_CGPROT.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.


There was 1 NOTE

GROMACS reminds you: "For those who want some proof that physicists are human, the proof is in the idiocy of all the different units which they use for measuring energy." (Richard Feynman)
