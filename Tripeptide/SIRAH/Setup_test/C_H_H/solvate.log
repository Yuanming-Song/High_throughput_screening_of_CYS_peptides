Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 8x8x8 boxes
Solvent box contains 31488 atoms in 7872 residues
Removed 4936 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 5012 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    WT4 (   4 atoms):  5385 residues
Generated solvent containing 21540 atoms in 5385 residues
Writing generated configuration to C_H_H_CG_solvated.gro

Output configuration contains 26340 atoms in 6285 residues
Volume                 :        2197 (nm^3)
Density                :     3034.66 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   5385   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up C_H_H_SIRAH.top to ./#C_H_H_SIRAH.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "For those who want some proof that physicists are human, the proof is in the idiocy of all the different units which they use for measuring energy." (Richard Feynman)
