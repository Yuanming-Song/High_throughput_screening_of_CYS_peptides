                      :-) GROMACS - gmx mdrun, 2022.1 (-:

Executable:   /opt/apps/gromacs/2022.1/gcc/8.4.0/cuda/11.7.1/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /opt/apps/gromacs/2022.1/gcc/8.4.0/cuda/11.7.1
Working dir:  /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/ML-MD-Peptide/CG_setup_test/A_A_C
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -nt 10 -deffnm A_A_C_CG_md


Back Off! I just backed up A_A_C_CG_md.log to ./#A_A_C_CG_md.log.1#
Compiled SIMD: AVX2_128, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see
log).
Reading file A_A_C_CG_md.tpr, VERSION 2022.1 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 20 to 25, rlist from 1.257 to 1.32

Using 1 MPI thread

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 10 OpenMP threads 

starting mdrun 'Title of the system'
2000000 steps,  50000.0 ps.


Received the INT signal, stopping within 25 steps


NOTE: 10 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
