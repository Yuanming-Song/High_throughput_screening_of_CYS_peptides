Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 8x8x8 boxes
Solvent box contains 31488 atoms in 7872 residues
Removed 4936 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 3716 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    WT4 (   4 atoms):  5709 residues
Generated solvent containing 22836 atoms in 5709 residues
Writing generated configuration to C_A_A_CG_solvated.gro

Output configuration contains 25836 atoms in 6609 residues
Volume                 :        2197 (nm^3)
Density                :     3200.03 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   5709   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up C_A_A_SIRAH.top to ./#C_A_A_SIRAH.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "I wanted to have a real language where programmers could write real programs, and see whether they would find the idea of data abstraction at all useful." (Barbara Liskov)

Adding line for 5709 solvent molecules with resname (WT4) to topology file (C_A_A_SIRAH.top)
