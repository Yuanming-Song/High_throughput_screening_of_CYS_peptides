  gmx_mpi mdrun -s /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/ML-MD-Peptide/SIRAH/Setup_test/Benchmark/C_A_A_SIRAH_md.tpr -deffnm C_A_A_SIRAH_md_A100_2gpus_replica1 -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu -update gpu

Compiled SIMD is AVX2_128, but AVX_512 might be faster (see log).

Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.224 to 1.396

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI process
Using 2 OpenMP threads 

starting mdrun 'Protein in water'
10000 steps,    200.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 47 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
