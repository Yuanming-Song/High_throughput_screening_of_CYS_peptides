Now, assuming these  combined_d data are already stored in different name for di tri and tetra peptides. What I need is to look at dAP and dEdge, and make a couple of plots. 1. Distribution of dAP for each peptide length, each colored differently and normalized on their own. 
2. Same for dEdge
3. 3 plots, dedge v.s. dAP, scatter plot, no need to color points in any way

do it in a new script, no need for WW scale base script nor amino acid definitions etc., simplely treat data and plot
