Reading file /dfs9/tw/yuanmis1/mrsec/ML-MD-Peptide/SIRAH/Setup_test/Benchmark/Dimer/C_A_A_SIRAH_md.tpr, VERSION 2024.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.225 to 1.398

Using 1 MPI process
Using 64 OpenMP threads 

starting mdrun 'Protein in water'
10000 steps,    200.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 13 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      4 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
