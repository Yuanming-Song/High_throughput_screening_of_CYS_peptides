  gmx mdrun -deffnm equilibration -v


Back Off! I just backed up equilibration.log to ./#equilibration.log.1#
Compiled SIMD: AVX2_128, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see
log).

NOTE: 10 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
